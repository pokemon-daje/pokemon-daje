###Requirements:
See all requirements [Here](https://github.com/ErGren/Smarmellearning/blob/main/it/lezione_speciale_pokemon/lezione_speciale_pokemon.md)

###Project description:
Pokemon Daje is a web application that:

- Handles Pokemon exchange requests sent by a client.
- Initially displays six random Pok√©mon from the stored collection, each with their respective characteristics.
- After the exchange, it will show the received Pokemon along with its information.

### _Spring Boot Framework and JDK 17_:
Spring Boot Framework and JDK 17 have made it possible to develop the project in a simpler and more 
optimized way, using updated libraries while meeting the requirements. Reasons for usage: after thorough 
reviews with the development team, the decision to use JDK 17 was made as it is one of the latest 
versions known and previously tested by the team.

### _Swagger_:
Swagger is an open-source framework used for designing, documenting, and visualizing APIs. 
It provides tools to describe API endpoints, request and response formats, and other related 
information, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with the API.

### _Docker_:
Docker is a platform that enables containerization of applications. 
It allows developers to package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations 
into a standardized unit called a container. 
These containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated from the underlying
system, making it easy to deploy and run applications consistently across 
different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
  
For all these reasons, we have decided to run the MySQL database in a Docker container

### _Mysql database_:
After carefully reading the requirements and having reasoned together, this type of database was chosen because:
- Open-source relational database (RDBMS),
- fast and lightweight for light workload applications where high performance on simple queries is critical.
- easy to use,
- displaying the structure of the database itself and the data stored in it,
  thus reducing errors and facilitating its construction, via 'workbench'.

###_Initial clone from git_:  
The project cloning, via HTTP, initially caused issues for our team. 
Therefore, we decided to switch to using SSH key since the usage of HTTP is 
outdated/deprecated. By generating individual SSH keys, we were able to 
successfully clone the project from the Git repository.
